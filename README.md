🚀 Project Name: Real-Time Emotion Recognition with Python, OpenCV & DeepFace 🎭

I’m excited to share a new project I’ve been working on — a real-time facial emotion recognition system that captures video from a webcam, analyzes facial expressions using deep learning, and displays the dominant emotion live on-screen.

🔍 Key Features:
    ✅ Real-time video capture and processing
    ✅ Emotion detection using DeepFace’s deep learning models
    ✅ Integration with OpenCV for smooth camera interaction
    ✅ Clean and customizable Python implementation

🧠 Technologies Used:
  - Python
  - OpenCV
  - DeepFace (with TensorFlow/Keras backend)
